# RPG_Battle_console
A python implementation of a text based/terminal battle game based on Joseph Delgadillo Udemy course, updated with my ideas:
 - added Rogue, Tank, White and Black Mage (no player's classes in base code)
 - added skills/spells to attack multiple enemies or heal entire party
 - you can use Cure/Cura/Curaga on any alive party member
 - added "alive" and "fainted" statuses, with a revive option
 - added critical damage option and defence to reduce damage taken
